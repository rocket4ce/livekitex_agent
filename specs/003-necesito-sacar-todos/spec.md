# Feature Specification: Clean Compilation - Zero Warnings

**Feature Branch**: `003-necesito-sacar-todos`
**Created**: October 7, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "necesito sacar todos los warnings cuando hago mix compile"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Clean Development Builds (Priority: P1)

As a developer working on the LivekitexAgent project, I need `mix compile` to complete without any warnings so that I can maintain code quality standards and identify real issues quickly without noise from known warnings.

**Why this priority**: Clean compilation is essential for development workflow and prevents warning fatigue that can mask real issues.

**Independent Test**: Run `mix compile` in the project root and verify zero warnings are emitted - delivers immediate value by providing clean feedback.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh checkout of the codebase, **When** developer runs `mix compile`, **Then** compilation succeeds with zero warnings
2. **Given** the codebase after fixes are applied, **When** developer runs `mix compile --warnings-as-errors`, **Then** compilation succeeds without errors

---

### User Story 2 - Continuous Integration Compatibility (Priority: P2)

As a project maintainer, I need clean compilation to work reliably in CI/CD pipelines so that automated quality checks can use `--warnings-as-errors` flag to enforce code quality.

**Why this priority**: Enables stricter quality controls in automated builds and ensures consistent code standards.

**Independent Test**: Configure CI with `--warnings-as-errors` and verify builds pass successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** CI pipeline with `mix compile --warnings-as-errors`, **When** code is pushed, **Then** build passes without compilation errors
2. **Given** a pull request with new code, **When** CI runs quality checks, **Then** no new warnings are introduced

---

### User Story 3 - Enhanced Code Maintainability (Priority: P3)

As a developer contributing to the project, I need all code to follow consistent patterns without warnings so that the codebase remains maintainable and follows Elixir best practices.

**Why this priority**: Improves long-term maintainability and reduces technical debt.

**Independent Test**: Code review process can focus on functionality rather than style issues.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** updated code following warning fixes, **When** reviewing code, **Then** patterns are consistent and follow Elixir conventions
2. **Given** new contributors to the project, **When** they run compilation, **Then** they see clean output that doesn't confuse or distract

### Edge Cases

- What happens when new warnings are introduced in future code changes? → Prevented by pre-commit hooks
- How does the system handle warnings from dependencies vs. project code? → Replace problematic dependencies with alternatives
- What occurs if some warnings cannot be fixed due to external library constraints? → Find alternative implementations
- What happens if pre-commit hooks fail or are bypassed?
- How are warnings handled during emergency hotfixes when hooks might be temporarily disabled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST compile without emitting unused variable warnings
- **FR-002**: System MUST compile without emitting unused module attribute warnings
- **FR-003**: System MUST compile without emitting deprecated function usage warnings
- **FR-004**: System MUST compile without emitting undefined function warnings
- **FR-005**: System MUST compile without emitting type-related warnings from gradual typing
- **FR-006**: System MUST compile without emitting clause ordering warnings
- **FR-007**: System MUST compile without emitting documentation warnings for private functions
- **FR-008**: System MUST compile without emitting pattern matching warnings
- **FR-009**: System MUST compile without emitting unused alias warnings
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain all existing functionality while eliminating warnings
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve existing API interfaces and behaviors
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle error cases properly even after warning fixes
- **FR-013**: System MUST use alternative libraries or implementations when existing dependencies generate unavoidable warnings
- **FR-014**: System MUST implement pre-commit hooks to prevent new warnings from being committed

### Key Entities

- **Warning Categories**: Unused variables, deprecated functions, type violations, undefined functions, clause ordering, documentation issues
- **Source Files**: All Elixir modules in lib/ directory that currently emit warnings
- **Compilation Process**: Mix build system and Elixir compiler

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Running `mix compile` produces zero warning messages
- **SC-002**: Running `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` succeeds without errors
- **SC-003**: All existing tests continue to pass after warning fixes are applied
- **SC-004**: Code compilation time does not increase by more than 5% after fixes
- **SC-005**: All 57 identified warnings from the compilation output are resolved
- **SC-006**: No new warnings are introduced during the fix process
- **SC-007**: Critical warnings (type violations, undefined functions) are resolved within 2 weeks
- **SC-008**: All warnings are resolved within 4-6 weeks through incremental development cycles

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07

- Q: When warnings cannot be eliminated without breaking functionality (e.g., due to external library limitations or architectural constraints), what should be the resolution approach? → A: Find alternative libraries or implementations that don't generate warnings
- Q: What is the acceptable timeline for completing all warning fixes while maintaining development velocity? → A: Incremental fixes over multiple cycles, prioritizing by severity (4-6 weeks)
- Q: How should the team handle prevention of new warnings in future development? → A: Add pre-commit hooks that block commits with new warnings

## Assumptions

- All warnings can be fixed without breaking existing functionality
- Some warnings may require code refactoring rather than simple variable renaming
- Dependencies may need updates if they contribute to warnings
- Type annotation improvements may be needed for gradual typing warnings
- Function signatures may need adjustment for unused parameter warnings
