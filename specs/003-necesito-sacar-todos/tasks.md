# Tasks: Clean Compilation - Zero Warnings

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-necesito-sacar-todos/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions


## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Clean Development Builds (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel if team capacity allows
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 â†’ P2 â†’ P3) for incremental delivery
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Phase 2 - No dependencies on other stories (MVP delivery)
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Phase 2 - Builds on US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Phase 2 - May reference patterns from US1/US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Simple fixes (Category A) can run in parallel - different files, no dependencies
- API corrections (Category B) can run in parallel - different functions and modules
- Architectural changes (Category C) may have dependencies due to type system interactions
- Validation tasks must run after implementation tasks within each story
- Progress tracking happens at end of each user story phase

### Parallel Opportunities

#### Phase 1 & 2 (Setup & Foundation)
- T002, T003 can run in parallel
- T005, T006 can run in parallel after T004 completes

#### User Story 1 (Simple Fixes)
- Tasks T009-T020 can all run in parallel (different files)
- Validation tasks T021-T024 run sequentially after implementation

#### User Story 2 (API Corrections)
- Tasks T025-T035 can run in parallel (different functions)
- Hook tasks T036-T039 can run in parallel with API fixes
- Validation tasks T040-T043 run sequentially after implementation

#### User Story 3 (Architecture)
- Exception handling tasks T044-T049 can run in parallel
- Dependency replacement tasks T052-T055 may need coordination
- Validation tasks T056-T060 run sequentially after architectural changes

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Simple Fixes)

```bash
# Launch all simple warning fixes in parallel:
Task T009: "Fix unused variables in health_server.ex"
Task T010: "Fix unused @valid_states in agent.ex"
Task T011: "Remove @doc from private functions in health_server.ex"
Task T012: "Fix unused variables in cli.ex"
Task T013: "Fix unused variables in metrics.ex"
Task T014: "Fix unused variables in worker_supervisor.ex"
Task T015: "Fix unused variables in function_tool.ex"
Task T016: "Fix unused variables in worker_manager.ex"
Task T017: "Fix unused alias in logger.ex"
Task T018: "Fix unused attributes in stt.ex"
Task T019: "Fix unused attribute in logger.ex"
Task T020: "Fix unused @tool in example_tools.ex"

# Then run validation sequentially:
Task T021: "Compile with --warnings-as-errors"
Task T022: "Run full test suite"
Task T023: "Benchmark compilation performance"
Task T024: "Update progress tracking"
```

## MVP Strategy

**Minimum Viable Product**: User Story 1 (Clean Development Builds)

- Delivers immediate value by eliminating ~25 simple warnings
- Provides clean compilation feedback for daily development
- Low risk implementation with high developer satisfaction impact
- Independent delivery without dependencies on CI/CD or architectural changes

**Incremental Value**: Each user story builds on previous ones while remaining independently valuable:
1. **US1**: Clean local development experience
2. **US2**: CI/CD quality enforcement + regression prevention
3. **US3**: Long-term maintainability and architectural consistency

**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks total, with deliverable value every 1-2 weeks per user story completion
