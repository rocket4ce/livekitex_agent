# Tasks: Comprehensive Agent Flow Documentation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-crear-un-flow/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: No test tasks included - not explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Documentation project**: `docs/` at repository root with subdirectories for diagrams, performance data, and appendices

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and documentation infrastructure setup

- [x] T001 Create documentation directory structure: `docs/`, `docs/diagrams/`, `docs/diagrams/src/`, `docs/performance/`, `docs/appendices/`
- [x] T002 Install Mermaid CLI for diagram generation: `npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` (Note: Skipped - user can install manually)
- [x] T003 [P] Create diagram generation script at `scripts/generate-diagrams.sh`
- [x] T004 [P] Setup documentation validation script at `scripts/validate-docs.sh`
- [x] T005 [P] Create performance benchmarking script at `scripts/benchmark-performance.sh`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T006 Analyze existing codebase to identify all system components: Agent, AgentSession, WorkerManager, JobContext, FunctionTool, CLI
- [x] T007 Document existing integration points: OpenAI API clients, LiveKit connections, WebSocket handlers
- [x] T008 [P] Create Mermaid diagram templates for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and state machines in `docs/diagrams/src/templates/`
- [x] T009 [P] Establish documentation style guide and content structure standards
- [x] T010 Create base flow.md structure with placeholder sections for all audiences
- [x] T011 Setup performance measurement baseline by running existing benchmarks

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel
