**Feature Branch**: `002-crear-un-flow`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "necesito crear un flow.md donde detalle todo el flujo de como funciona el agente esta es la documentacion de https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime esta es la documentacion de livekit agent https://docs.livekit.io/agents/ tienes que leer tambien todo el codigo de elixir para poder completar la tarea, aca toda la documentacion de livekitex"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07

- Q: What format should the flow documentation prioritize? → A: Diagram-heavy with flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and visual representations
- Q: What technical expertise level should the documentation assume for its primary audience? → A: Multi-layered with basic overviews and detailed technical appendices
- Q: Which performance aspects should the flow documentation prioritize? → A: Comprehensive coverage of latency, throughput, and resource metrics

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Developer Understanding Agent Architecture (Priority: P1)

New developers and contributors need to understand how the LivekitexAgent system works internally - from initialization to real-time conversation handling - to contribute effectively to the project. They need both high-level overviews for quick understanding and detailed technical appendices for deep implementation work.

**Why this priority**: Essential foundational knowledge required before any development work can begin. Without understanding the flow, developers cannot implement features, debug issues, or optimize performance.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by asking a new developer to read the flow documentation and then explain the agent lifecycle, session management, and key integration points without referring to source code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new developer joins the project, **When** they read the flow documentation, **Then** they can explain the complete agent initialization process
2. **Given** the flow documentation exists, **When** a developer needs to debug a session issue, **Then** they can identify which components are involved and their interaction patterns
3. **Given** comprehensive flow documentation, **When** someone wants to add a new AI provider, **Then** they understand exactly which interfaces to implement and where to integrate

### User Story 2 - Production Deployment Planning (Priority: P2)

DevOps engineers and system architects need to understand the complete system flow to plan production deployments, scaling strategies, and monitoring requirements.

**Why this priority**: Critical for production readiness and operational excellence. Proper deployment requires understanding of all system components and their dependencies.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having a DevOps engineer use the flow documentation to create a deployment plan that includes all necessary services, scaling considerations, and monitoring points.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** flow documentation with deployment details, **When** planning production deployment, **Then** all required LiveKit, OpenAI, and infrastructure components are identified
2. **Given** comprehensive system flow, **When** setting up monitoring, **Then** all critical health check points and metrics collection points are covered
3. **Given** detailed component interactions, **When** planning for high availability, **Then** single points of failure and scaling bottlenecks are identified

### User Story 3 - Integration and Customization Guide (Priority: P3)

Developers integrating LivekitexAgent into existing systems need to understand how to customize the flow for their specific use cases and integrate with external services.

**Why this priority**: Enables adoption and customization for specific business needs. Important for ecosystem growth but not critical for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having a developer use the flow documentation to successfully integrate the agent with a custom LLM provider or add custom middleware to the processing pipeline.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** flow documentation with extension points, **When** integrating custom AI providers, **Then** the integration points and required interfaces are clearly defined
2. **Given** detailed processing pipeline documentation, **When** adding custom middleware, **Then** the insertion points and data flow are well understood
3. **Given** comprehensive event system documentation, **When** building custom monitoring, **Then** all available events and their payloads are documented

### Edge Cases

- How does the flow handle OpenAI Realtime API connection failures and fallback to traditional STT/LLM/TTS pipeline?
- What happens when LiveKit room connection is lost during an active conversation?
- How does the system handle concurrent tool calls and response generation?
- What occurs when the agent session exceeds configured timeout limits?
- How does the flow manage memory cleanup when handling long-running conversations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
