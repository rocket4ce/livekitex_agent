# Research: Comprehensive Agent Flow Documentation

**Feature**: 002-crear-un-flow
**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Phase**: 0 (Outline & Research)

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. Diagram Creation Tools and Standards

**Decision**: Use Mermaid syntax for diagrams with SVG export capability
**Rationale**: Mermaid provides excellent flowchart, sequence diagram, and state diagram support. It's text-based (version controllable), widely supported in Markdown renderers, and can export to SVG for high-quality documentation.
**Alternatives considered**: PlantUML (more complex syntax), Draw.io (not version-controllable), Lucidchart (commercial, not code-friendly)

### 2. Multi-layered Documentation Structure Best Practices

**Decision**: Use progressive disclosure pattern with overview → details → appendices structure
**Rationale**: Allows both quick understanding (overview) and deep technical work (appendices). Follows established technical documentation patterns from companies like Stripe, GitHub, and Atlassian.
**Alternatives considered**: Single comprehensive document (overwhelming), separate documents per audience (fragmented), interactive documentation (over-engineered for this scope)

### 3. Performance Metrics Documentation Standards

**Decision**: Document actual measured metrics from existing codebase with benchmarking methodology
**Rationale**: Provides concrete, actionable performance data rather than theoretical estimates. Includes latency (p50, p95, p99), throughput (sessions/second, messages/second), and resource utilization (memory, CPU) with measurement conditions.
**Alternatives considered**: Theoretical performance targets (not validated), Generic performance guidelines (not specific enough), No performance documentation (incomplete)

### 4. Elixir/OTP Flow Documentation Patterns

**Decision**: Use OTP supervision tree diagrams combined with GenServer state machine representations
**Rationale**: Elixir developers understand OTP patterns, so documentation should leverage familiar concepts. State diagrams show process lifecycle, supervision trees show fault tolerance, and message flow diagrams show inter-process communication.
**Alternatives considered**: Generic flowcharts (miss OTP specifics), Code-only documentation (not visual), UML diagrams (not Elixir-specific)

### 5. OpenAI Realtime API Integration Documentation

**Decision**: Document both realtime and fallback pipeline flows with decision trees
**Rationale**: System supports both OpenAI Realtime API and traditional STT/LLM/TTS pipeline. Documentation must show when each is used, how fallback works, and performance implications of each approach.
**Alternatives considered**: Realtime-only documentation (incomplete), Separate documentation per mode (fragmented), High-level overview only (insufficient detail)

### 6. LiveKit Agent Documentation Alignment

**Decision**: Map Elixir implementation to Python LiveKit Agent concepts with equivalency tables
**Rationale**: Many developers familiar with Python LiveKit Agents need to understand Elixir equivalent. Provides migration/comparison guide and ensures feature parity documentation.
**Alternatives considered**: Standalone Elixir documentation (misses context), Python-centric documentation (wrong focus), Generic agent documentation (not specific enough)

## Resolved Technical Unknowns

All technical context items were already clear from the existing codebase analysis:
- ✅ Language/Version: Elixir ~> 1.12, OTP 24+ (confirmed from mix.exs)
- ✅ Dependencies: livekitex, websockex, httpoison, etc. (confirmed from codebase)
- ✅ Performance Goals: Sub-100ms latency requirements (confirmed from constitution)
- ✅ Scale/Scope: Complete system documentation (confirmed from functional requirements)

## Next Phase Prerequisites Met

✅ All research tasks completed
✅ No NEEDS CLARIFICATION items remain
✅ Documentation approach and tooling decided
✅ Ready to proceed to Phase 1: Design & Contracts
