# Tasks: LivekitexAgent Complete

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-complete-agent-specification/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - May enhance US1 tools but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Builds on US1/US2 for production deployment
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational - Enhances US1 with real-time features
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent Phoenix integration

### Within Each User Story

- Models/entities before services
- Services before endpoints/interfaces
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All provider implementations within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all provider implementations for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Implement OpenAI provider integration for LLM in lib/livekitex_agent/providers/openai/llm.ex"
Task: "Implement OpenAI STT provider in lib/livekitex_agent/providers/openai/stt.ex"
Task: "Implement OpenAI TTS provider in lib/livekitex_agent/providers/openai/tts.ex"

# Launch supporting modules for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Enhance AgentSession with conversation state tracking"
Task: "Implement performance metrics collection"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Voice Agent Developer)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Function Tool Creator)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Enterprise Developer)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Real-time Application Builder)
   - Developer E: User Story 5 (Phoenix Developer)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

### Parallel Opportunities Identified

- 45 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phases
- 5 user stories can be developed in parallel after foundational completion
- Estimated 60% parallelization potential with adequate team size

### Independent Test Criteria

- **US1**: Create and deploy a working voice agent with conversation capabilities
- **US2**: Define, register, and execute custom function tools with validation
- **US3**: Deploy production worker pool with monitoring and load balancing
- **US4**: Achieve sub-100ms voice processing with VAD and interruption handling
- **US5**: Integrate voice agents into Phoenix LiveView with real-time updates

### Suggested MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product**: Complete Phase 1 (Setup) + Phase 2 (Foundational) + Phase 3 (User Story 1)

This delivers a complete voice agent system with:
- Agent creation and configuration
- Session management with conversation state
- OpenAI provider integration (LLM/STT/TTS)
- WebRTC audio processing
- Basic metrics and monitoring
- Working examples and documentation

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within the same phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Focus on MVP first (User Story 1) for fastest time-to-value
