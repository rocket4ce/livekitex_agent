# Research: LivekitexAgent Implementation

## Decision Matrix

### Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Implementation

**Decision**: Implement WebRTC VAD integration through livekitex with fallback to silence detection
**Rationale**:
- LiveKit infrastructure provides WebRTC VAD capabilities natively
- Reduces external dependencies and maintains protocol consistency
- Fallback ensures functionality even with basic audio streams
- Lower latency than cloud-based VAD services

**Alternatives considered**:
- Cloud VAD services (Google, Azure) - Added latency and complexity
- Pure Elixir VAD implementation - Complex audio processing requirements
- WebRTC.ai integration - Additional dependency management

### Speech Interruption Handling

**Decision**: Implement speech handle system with audio buffer management and event-driven interruption
**Rationale**:
- Enables natural conversation flow with interruption capabilities
- Buffer management allows for rollback and context preservation
- Event-driven approach fits well with Elixir message passing
- Critical for real-time conversation user experience

**Alternatives considered**:
- Simple turn-based conversation - Unnatural interaction patterns
- Client-side interruption handling - Inconsistent behavior across clients
- Queue-based approach - Doesn't support true interruption

### Plugin Architecture for AI Providers

**Decision**: Behaviour-based plugin system with registry and dynamic loading
**Rationale**:
- Elixir behaviours provide clear contracts and type safety
- Registry enables runtime provider selection and configuration
- Dynamic loading supports extensibility without recompilation
- Maintains consistency with OTP patterns

**Alternatives considered**:
- Static provider compilation - Limited extensibility
- GenServer-based providers - Unnecessary state management overhead
- Macro-based provider definition - Complex debugging and maintenance

### Real-time Audio Processing Pipeline

**Decision**: GenStage-based audio processing pipeline with back-pressure handling
**Rationale**:
- GenStage provides excellent back-pressure management for real-time streams
- Fits naturally with Elixir's actor model and supervision trees
- Supports pipeline composition and error isolation
- Proven pattern for audio/video processing in Elixir

**Alternatives considered**:
- GenServer message passing - Poor back-pressure handling
- Flow-based processing - Overkill for linear audio pipeline
- External audio processing - Additional complexity and latency

### Session State Persistence Strategy

**Decision**: ETS-based in-memory storage with optional persistence adapters
**Rationale**:
- ETS provides fast, concurrent access for real-time requirements
- In-memory storage meets sub-100ms latency requirements
- Adapter pattern allows for external persistence when needed
- Fits with let-it-crash philosophy for session recovery

**Alternatives considered**:
- PostgreSQL persistence - Too slow for real-time requirements
- Redis integration - Additional infrastructure dependency
- File-based persistence - Poor concurrent access patterns

### WebRTC Integration Approach

**Decision**: Full integration through livekitex library with LiveKit infrastructure
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing livekitex investment and expertise
- Maintains protocol compatibility and reduces implementation complexity
- LiveKit infrastructure handles WebRTC complexities (STUN/TURN, etc.)
- Enables seamless integration with existing LiveKit deployments

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct WebRTC implementation - Significant complexity and maintenance
- Alternative WebRTC libraries - Integration complexity with LiveKit
- WebSocket-only approach - Limited functionality and compatibility

### Function Tool Execution Model

**Decision**: Task-based execution with timeout and cancellation support
**Rationale**:
- Elixir Tasks provide excellent isolation and timeout handling
- Supports concurrent tool execution without blocking sessions
- Natural integration with OTP supervision for error handling
- Enables proper resource cleanup and cancellation

**Alternatives considered**:
- GenServer-based execution - Unnecessary state management
- Synchronous execution - Blocks session during tool execution
- Process pool approach - Complex resource management

### Audio Format Standardization

**Decision**: PCM16 as primary format with conversion utilities
**Rationale**:
- PCM16 is the standard for LiveKit and most real-time audio systems
- Provides good quality-to-bandwidth ratio for voice
- Well-supported across audio processing libraries
- Matches Python LiveKit Agent implementation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Multiple format support - Added complexity without clear benefit
- Higher quality formats - Unnecessary bandwidth usage for voice
- Compressed formats - Added latency for real-time processing

### Error Handling and Recovery Strategy

**Decision**: Circuit breaker pattern with exponential backoff and graceful degradation
**Rationale**:
- Prevents cascade failures in distributed systems
- Maintains service availability during partial failures
- Exponential backoff reduces load on failing services
- Graceful degradation preserves core functionality

**Alternatives considered**:
- Simple retry logic - Potential for cascade failures
- Immediate failure - Poor user experience
- Manual intervention - Not suitable for production systems

### Development and Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Property-based testing with StreamData for audio processing, mock providers for integration
**Rationale**:
- Property-based testing catches edge cases in audio processing
- Mock providers enable reliable testing without external dependencies
- Fits well with Elixir testing ecosystem and practices
- Enables comprehensive test coverage for real-time systems

**Alternatives considered**:
- Unit testing only - Insufficient coverage for complex audio processing
- External service testing - Unreliable and slow test suite
- Manual testing only - Not suitable for continuous integration
