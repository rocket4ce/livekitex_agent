# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Phoenix Integration Configuration Error

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 7, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation items pass successfully. The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

The specification focuses on the core issue: ensuring WorkerManager receives properly configured WorkerOptions instead of empty lists, which causes the KeyError. All requirements are testable and technology-agnostic, focusing on the user experience of successful application startup rather than specific implementation details.
