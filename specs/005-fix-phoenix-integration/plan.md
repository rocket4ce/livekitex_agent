# Implementation Plan: Fix Phoenix Integration Configuration Error

**Branch**: `005-fix-phoenix-integration` | **Date**: October 7, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/005-fix-phoenix-integration/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Fix the KeyError during Phoenix application startup where WorkerManager receives an empty list instead of a properly configured WorkerOptions struct. The issue occurs in `Application.resolve_worker_options()` where configuration resolution fails, causing `worker_options.worker_pool_size` access to throw a KeyError. The solution involves ensuring robust configuration handling, proper fallback mechanisms, and validation of WorkerOptions struct creation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Elixir ~> 1.12, OTP 24+
**Primary Dependencies**: livekitex ~> 0.1.34, websockex, httpoison, hackney, jason, timex
**Storage**: ETS tables for session state (ephemeral), Application config for settings
**Testing**: ExUnit (built-in Elixir testing framework)
**Target Platform**: BEAM VM (Linux/macOS servers), Phoenix web applications
**Project Type**: OTP library with Phoenix integration capabilities
**Performance Goals**: Application startup under 10 seconds, configuration resolution under 1 second
**Constraints**: Must not break existing Phoenix applications, maintain backward compatibility
**Scale/Scope**: Single library fix affecting application startup sequence, ~5-10 files modified

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Initial Check (Pre-Phase 0)**:
✅ **LiveKitEx Foundation**: Feature maintains dependency on livekitex ~> 0.1.34, no direct protocol implementations
✅ **OTP Supervision & Fault Tolerance**: Fix enhances fault tolerance by preventing startup crashes
✅ **Required Stack Compliance**: Uses Elixir ~> 1.12, OTP supervision, existing dependencies
✅ **No External Integration Changes**: Internal configuration fix, no new integrations required
✅ **Test-First Development**: Will include unit tests for configuration handling
✅ **Quality Gates**: Credo/Dialyzer compliance maintained, test coverage requirements met

**Post-Phase 1 Design Validation**:
✅ **Real-Time Audio/Video First**: Configuration fix ensures agent startup doesn't block real-time capabilities
✅ **Agent-Centric Architecture**: Preserves Agent abstraction and WorkerOptions contract
✅ **CLI & Development Experience**: Improves developer experience with better error messages and fallback behavior
✅ **Python LiveKit Agent Parity**: Internal robustness fix doesn't affect feature parity
✅ **Technology Constraints**: All solutions use approved stack (Elixir/OTP, existing dependencies)

**Final Gate Status**: ✅ PASS - All constitutional requirements satisfied after design phase. Implementation aligns with OTP principles and improves system resilience.

```

**Structure Decision**: Single Elixir library project structure. The fix targets existing files in the `lib/livekitex_agent/` directory, primarily focusing on the application startup sequence and configuration handling. No new major modules required - this is a robustness improvement to existing code paths.
