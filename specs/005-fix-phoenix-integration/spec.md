# Feature Specification: Fix Phoenix Integration Configuration Error

**Feature Branch**: `005-fix-phoenix-integration`
**Created**: October 7, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Fix Phoenix integration configuration error - missing worker_pool_size key causing application startup failure"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Agent Application Starts Successfully (Priority: P1)

When a developer integrates livekitex_agent into a Phoenix application and starts the server, the application should initialize without configuration errors and be ready to handle agent requests.

**Why this priority**: This is critical for basic functionality - users cannot use the library if it fails to start.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding livekitex_agent to a Phoenix project's dependencies, running `mix phx.server`, and verifying the application starts without KeyError exceptions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Phoenix application with livekitex_agent added as dependency, **When** running `mix phx.server`, **Then** the application starts successfully without KeyError exceptions
2. **Given** livekitex_agent is configured with default settings, **When** the WorkerManager initializes, **Then** it receives a proper WorkerOptions struct with all required fields
3. **Given** no explicit worker configuration is provided, **When** the application starts, **Then** sensible defaults are automatically applied including worker_pool_size

---

### User Story 2 - Configuration Validation and Error Messages (Priority: P2)

When configuration issues occur, developers should receive clear error messages that help them identify and fix the problem quickly.

**Why this priority**: Good developer experience is important but not critical for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by intentionally providing invalid configurations and verifying helpful error messages are displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** invalid worker configuration is provided, **When** the application starts, **Then** clear error messages indicate what is wrong and how to fix it
2. **Given** a configuration parsing error occurs, **When** the fallback mechanism activates, **Then** the application starts with emergency defaults and logs the issue

---

### User Story 3 - Graceful Fallback Mechanism (Priority: P3)

When configuration resolution fails, the system should fall back to safe defaults rather than crashing, allowing the application to start and function with basic capabilities.

**Why this priority**: Nice-to-have resilience feature that improves reliability but isn't essential for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating configuration failures and verifying the application still starts with fallback configuration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** WorkerOptions.from_config() throws an exception, **When** the application initializes, **Then** it falls back to emergency defaults and continues startup
2. **Given** the fallback mechanism is activated, **When** the application is running, **Then** basic agent functionality remains available

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Application.get_env returns unexpected data types (not keyword lists)?
- How does system handle partial configuration where some required keys are missing?
- What occurs when the WorkerManager receives nil instead of WorkerOptions struct?
- How does the system behave when System.schedulers_online() returns unexpected values?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST ensure WorkerManager always receives a valid WorkerOptions struct with all required fields populated
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide default values for all WorkerOptions fields when user configuration is incomplete
- **FR-003**: Configuration resolution MUST handle cases where Application.get_env returns empty lists, nil, or malformed data
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate that worker_pool_size is always a positive integer before creating WorkerOptions
- **FR-005**: Error handling MUST prevent application crashes during WorkerOptions initialization
- **FR-006**: System MUST log clear diagnostic messages when configuration issues are detected and resolved
- **FR-007**: Fallback mechanism MUST provide emergency defaults that allow basic agent functionality to work

### Key Entities

- **WorkerOptions**: Configuration structure containing worker_pool_size, timeout, entry_point, and other operational parameters
- **Application Configuration**: Environment-based settings from config.exs that provide user customization
- **WorkerManager**: Process that manages agent workers and requires valid WorkerOptions to initialize properly

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Phoenix applications with livekitex_agent dependency start successfully in under 10 seconds without KeyError exceptions
- **SC-002**: Configuration resolution succeeds in 100% of cases, either with user config or fallback defaults
- **SC-003**: Error messages provide actionable guidance that allows developers to fix configuration issues in under 5 minutes
- **SC-004**: Fallback mechanism activates within 1 second when primary configuration fails, preventing application crashes
- **SC-005**: All WorkerOptions fields have appropriate default values that enable basic agent functionality without user configuration
