# Feature Specification: Fix Phoenix Integration Configuration Issue

**Feature Branch**: `004-fix-phoenix-integration`
**Created**: 7 de octubre de 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "al momento de agregar la libreria en un proyecto en phoenix 1.8.1 me sale el siguiente error ** (Mix) Could not start application livekitex_agent: LivekitexAgent.Application.start(:normal, []) returned an error: shutdown: failed to start child: LivekitexAgent.WorkerManager ** (EXIT) an exception was raised: ** (KeyError) key :worker_pool_size not found in: []"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Phoenix Developer Library Integration (Priority: P1)

A Phoenix 1.8.1 developer adds livekitex_agent as a dependency to their project and expects it to start successfully without requiring manual configuration.

**Why this priority**: This is critical because it prevents any Phoenix developer from using the library. If developers can't get past the basic integration step, the library becomes unusable in Phoenix projects.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding livekitex_agent as a dependency to a fresh Phoenix 1.8.1 project, running `mix deps.get` and `mix phx.server`, and verifying the application starts without errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh Phoenix 1.8.1 project, **When** a developer adds `{:livekitex_agent, "~> 0.1.0"}` to deps and runs `mix deps.get && mix phx.server`, **Then** the Phoenix server starts successfully without WorkerManager configuration errors
2. **Given** an existing Phoenix project with livekitex_agent dependency, **When** the application restarts, **Then** all livekitex_agent processes initialize with sensible default values
3. **Given** a Phoenix project using livekitex_agent, **When** no custom worker configuration is provided, **Then** the system uses reasonable defaults suitable for Phoenix development environment

---

### User Story 2 - Custom Configuration Override (Priority: P2)

A Phoenix developer wants to customize worker pool settings for their specific use case while maintaining compatibility with Phoenix application lifecycle.

**Why this priority**: While not critical for basic functionality, developers need the ability to tune performance parameters for production deployments.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring custom worker options in config.exs, restarting the application, and verifying the custom settings are applied correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Phoenix project with livekitex_agent configured with custom worker_pool_size, **When** the application starts, **Then** the WorkerManager uses the custom configuration values
2. **Given** partial configuration provided in config.exs, **When** the application starts, **Then** missing values fall back to sensible defaults

---

### User Story 3 - Error Reporting and Diagnostics (Priority: P3)

A developer encounters configuration issues and receives clear error messages explaining what's missing and how to fix it.

**Why this priority**: Good developer experience, but not blocking basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing invalid configuration and verifying error messages are clear and actionable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** invalid worker configuration values, **When** the application starts, **Then** clear error messages explain what's wrong and suggest corrections

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Phoenix application starts but LiveKit server is not available?
- How does system handle partial configuration (some options provided, others missing)?
- What occurs during application hot code reloading in development?
- How does the system behave when worker_pool_size is set to zero or negative values?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST start successfully in Phoenix 1.8.1 applications without requiring explicit worker configuration
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide sensible default values for all required worker options when none are specified
- **FR-003**: System MUST read configuration from Phoenix application config when available
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate configuration values and provide clear error messages for invalid settings
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing configuration approaches
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle missing configuration keys gracefully by using defaults
- **FR-007**: System MUST integrate properly with Phoenix supervision tree lifecycle

### Key Entities

- **WorkerOptions**: Configuration object containing all worker behavior settings including pool size, timeouts, and connection parameters
- **Application Configuration**: Phoenix-style config that provides default and custom values for worker options
- **WorkerManager**: GenServer that manages worker pool and requires properly initialized WorkerOptions to start

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Phoenix 1.8.1 developers can add livekitex_agent dependency and start their application in under 2 minutes without configuration errors
- **SC-002**: System starts successfully with default configuration in 100% of Phoenix projects that include the dependency
- **SC-003**: Configuration validation catches 95% of invalid settings and provides actionable error messages
- **SC-004**: Zero breaking changes to existing configuration patterns for current users

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

- Phoenix developers expect libraries to work with minimal configuration (following Phoenix conventions)
- Default worker pool size should scale with available system resources (CPU cores)
- Configuration should follow Elixir/Phoenix standards using Application.get_env/3
- The library should be compatible with Phoenix's hot code reloading during development
- Most Phoenix applications will run in development with default settings and customize for production

## Dependencies

- Must maintain compatibility with Phoenix 1.8.1 application lifecycle
- Requires proper integration with Elixir Application behavior
- Must work with existing Elixir configuration system (config.exs files)

## Out of Scope

- Changes to core WorkerManager functionality beyond configuration initialization
- Performance optimizations for worker pool management
- New configuration formats or systems
- Changes to LiveKit connection handling or agent behavior
