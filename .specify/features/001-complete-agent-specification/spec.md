# LivekitexAgent Complete Specification

## Overview

LivekitexAgent is an Elixir library that provides a complete clone of Python LiveKit Agents functionality, designed for building real-time conversational AI agents with audio/video capabilities. The library leverages the custom `livekitex` library for LiveKit protocol communication and follows Elixir/OTP best practices for fault tolerance and concurrency.

## Context

### Current State Analysis

**Existing Implementation (Beta)**:
- ✅ Core Agent configuration with instructions, tools, and IDs
- ✅ AgentSession management with conversation state and event callbacks
- ✅ Function tools system with macro-based `@tool` decorators and registry
- ✅ Job/Run contexts for tool execution environment
- ✅ Worker options and supervisor architecture
- ✅ CLI utilities for dev/prod deployment
- ✅ Basic realtime audio support via WebSocket
- ✅ Integration with OpenAI APIs (LLM/STT/TTS)
- ✅ Example implementations and demo scripts

**Python LiveKit Reference Architecture**:
- Agent classes with instructions, STT/TTS/LLM/VAD components
- AgentSession for room management and conversation handling
- Function calling with `@function_tool` decorators
- Worker system with JobContext and entry points
- Plugin architecture for different AI providers
- Voice activity detection and speech handling
- Real-time WebRTC communication through LiveKit

### Gap Analysis

**Missing Critical Components**:
1. **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)** - No native VAD implementation
2. **Speech Handle System** - Missing speech interruption and control
3. **Real-time WebRTC Integration** - Limited to basic WebSocket audio
4. **Plugin Architecture** - No extensible provider system
5. **Advanced Session Management** - Missing room participant handling
6. **Metrics and Telemetry** - Basic metrics without comprehensive collection
7. **Stream Processing** - No audio/video stream pipeline management
